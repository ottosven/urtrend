# urtrend

The goal of backCUSUM is to provide functionality to apply the methods
developed in the paper “[Unit Root Testing with Slowly Varying Trends](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04066)” by [Sven
Otto](https://www.svenotto.com). 
The repository also provides code to replicate all simulation results in
this paper.
